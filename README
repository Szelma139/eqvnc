eqvnc - VNC Viewer for Equalizer
================================

This is a VNC Viewer on top of the Equalizer framework for distributed OpenGL
rendering. You can use it to view VNC desktops across multiple displays,
graphics cards, and/or hosts.

It requires libvncclient <http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/> and Equalizer
<http://www.equalizergraphics.com/>.


eqvnc accepts three types of options: eqvnc options, Equalizer options, and
libvncclient options. Specify eqvnc options first, then Equalizer options, and
then VNC options and arguments. For example:

$ ./eqvnc --view-only --eq-config my-conf.eqc -compress 9 my-vncserver:0

eqvnc options:
--view-only
  Disable keyboard and mouse interaction; just view the desktop.
--screen=canvas
  Draw the VNC desktop onto the canvas specified in the Equalizer
  configuration. This is the default and should work in most situations.
--screen=wall,blx,bly,blz,brx,bry,brz,tlx,tly,tlz
  Draw the VNC desktop on a 3D wall given by the coordinates of the bottom left,
  bottom right, and top left corners.
--screen=cylinder,cx,cy,cz,ux,uy,uz,r,phi0,phirange,thetarange
  Draw the VNC desktop on a 3D cylindrical screen given by the cylinder
  center, cylinder up vector, cylinder radius, azimuth angle of screen center
  (phi0), and the aperture angles for azimuth (phirange) and polar
  (thetarange) directions.
--lookat=ex,ey,ez,cx,cy,cz,ux,uy,uz
  Set the observer position and viewing direction using the given eye and
  center points and an up vector (similar to gluLookAt). This only makes sens
  for --screen=wall and --screen=cylinder.

Limitations:
- Mouse interaction only works with --screen=canvas.
- Keyboard interaction only works rudimentary because of limitations in the
  Equalizer key event model. Modifier keys don't work, and non-ascii keys will
  probably cause trouble.
